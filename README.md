# A Library for Different Short Forms of Code

I will be adding algorithms I learn about, as well as any type of other short form code that seems interesting to me. I will continue adding to this repo as I progress as a developer, meaning the code will get more complicated as time goes by.

I will also be combining programming languages, mainly python and javascript.

Enjoy!
